# weather-forecast-sixth

Find the link to my deployed app here: 

I've created a weather app that retrieves data from the Open Weather API for the current weather in a city of choice alongside the 5 day forecast for this same location! 

The user is able to search for any city in the world, once the search is complete and we've got updated data, we can proceed to make a new search - but thanks to localStorage, we save the value of that city in the memory of the browser.
